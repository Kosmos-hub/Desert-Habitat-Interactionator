#  Desert Habitat Interactionator XD

A living, evolving **desert ecosystem simulator** where every creature, plant, and scent matters.  
The world isn’t coded to behave — it **emerges** from the rules of energy, hunger, and instinct.

In this simulation, autonomous organisms interact in a delicate desert environment.  
Each species has its own motivations and biological limits, shaping a dynamic ecosystem through:
- **Competition** for food and survival  
- **Predation** as a natural population control  
- **Reproduction** within safe nests through visible mating calls  
- **Energy flow** through digestion, metabolism, and decay  

No creature is directly scripted — their choices come from evolving genetics and situational priorities.

## Ecosystem Mechanics  ₍^. .^₎⟆
| System | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Food Web** | Energy begins with scattered plant matter that herbivores consume, which then feed the predators. |
| **Digestion Cycle** | Plant-based diets digest fast but give short bursts of energy; meat digests slowly but yields more long-term. |
| **Mating Behavior** | When energy levels are high, creatures emit visual mating calls, return to their nests, and pair up to produce offspring. |
| **Nesting Zones** | Predators and prey maintain separate safe zones — predators cannot hunt within prey nests. |
| **Scent Trails** | Every movement leaves a fading scent that spreads, letting predators track prey and herbivores retrace food sources. |
| **Evolutionary Drift** | Offspring inherit and mutate traits such as size, speed, vision, metabolism, and aggression. |

##  Key Parameters                          /\_/\
##                                       = (• . •) =
##                                         /     \     
- **Size** → affects digestion, energy storage, and visibility  
- **Speed** → determines agility and energy cost per movement  
- **Vision** → defines awareness radius and hunting efficiency  
- **Aggression** → separates predators from prey  
- **Metabolism** → controls hunger rate and efficiency  

These genes shift over generations, leading to emergent species behavior and ecosystem balance (or collapse).

##  Emergent Dynamics
- Overpopulation causes **resource crashes** and die-offs  
- Limited nests create **breeding bottlenecks**  
- Predator starvation leads to **prey booms**  
- Herbivore overfeeding can **trigger extinction cascades**  
- Occasionally, mutations create **hybrid strategies** (omnivores, scouts, etc.)

Every run evolves differently — no two deserts stabilize the same way.

##  Running the Simulation
```bash
pip install pygame
python main.py

Use right-click to pause, left-click to inspect creatures, and watch their live priorities (hunger, fear, mating) update in real time.

Future Goals
- Decomposer species that recycle dead energy
- AI-driven adaptation memory
- Weather and seasonal energy cycles
- Exportable evolution data for analytics
